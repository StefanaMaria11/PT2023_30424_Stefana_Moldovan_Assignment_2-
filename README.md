The objective of this project is to design and implement a queues management application to minimize client waiting time.

The project involves modeling and analyzing the problem, including scenarios and use cases. It utilizes UML diagrams to illustrate user actions and system functionalities. The application allows users to input parameters such as the number of clients, queues, and simulation time. It simulates a queue management system commonly used in service-oriented industries.

Design:

Class Diagrams and Packages: The project is structured into three packages: BusinessLogic, Model, and View. Each package contains classes responsible for different aspects of the application, such as core logic, data structures, and user interface.

Data Structures: Various data structures like LinkedList, List, Array, and others are utilized for efficient task management and simulation.


The implementation focuses on class design, utilizing strategies such as ConcreteStrategyQueue and ConcreteStrategyTime for task assignment. The SimulationManager class manages the simulation process, generating random tasks and updating server queues.
